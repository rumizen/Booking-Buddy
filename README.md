## By [Steve Rumizen](https://github.com/rumizen)


### Background
This was an assigned solo project for Front-End Mod 2 of Turing School of Software & Design. The objective was to create a hotel-management application given provided user stories and APIs with correlated datasets. There were no guidelines for data-structure, design, or UX.

### Other notes

I decided to work from a mobile layout first and expand outward since i was building the app from scratch. This allowed for a more efficient MVP process where I could add features without too much resistance. This was also my first project with the use of splash pages integrated into the UI.

If I had more time beyond the given week for this project, I'd refine the styling for browser windows to make it more user-friendly. I'd also add additional functionality in terms of placing room service orders for a selected customer.
